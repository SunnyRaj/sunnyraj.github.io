  <h1>Page Not Found</h1>
  <p>Well, this is awkward. You were all set to see something, learn something,
  discover something... and there's nothing here. Whoops.</p>
  <p>Maybe it's your fault for mistyping the URL. Maybe it's my fault for
  breaking a link. Maybe we should share the blame, and move on. That last one
  sounds nice, let's do that.</p>
  <p>Perhaps you could find what you're looking for if you went
  <a href="{{ '/'|url }}">back to the home page?</a></p>
