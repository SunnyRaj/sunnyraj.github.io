description:

In this project, we formulated and investigated the novel problem of finding the skyline k-tuple groups from an n-tuple data setâ€”i.e., groups of k tuples which are not dominated by any other group of equal size, based on aggregate-based group dominance relationship. The major technical challenge was to identify effective anti-monotonic properties for pruning the search space of skyline groups.
